I always needed time on my own
I never thought I'd need you there when I cried
And the days feel like years when I'm alone
And the bed where you lie is made up on your side

When you walk away
I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now?

I've never felt this way before
Everything that I do
Reminds me of you
And the clothes you left they lie on the floor
And they smell just like you
I love the things that you do
